I currently work as a back-end developer, I deal daily with new challenges that allow me to acquire more experience and knowledge, ranging from TDD applications to microservices. I am in the final stretch of my graduation in Information Systems at Centro Universitário Paraíso do Ceará, where I have contact with new technologies and the solidification of my theoretical bases.
