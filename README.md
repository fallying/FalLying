> :octocat: Aspiring software engineer.

I currently work as a back-end developer, I deal daily with new challenges that allow me to acquire more experience and knowledge, ranging from TDD applications to microservices.

I am in the final stretch of my graduation in Information Systems at Centro Universitário Paraíso do Ceará, where I have contact with new technologies and the solidification of my theoretical bases.

And daily I look to delve into new technologies and software architectures. Like which, I use in personal projects, some of which are: Nodejs, Express, Prisma 2, TDD, GraphQl, ReactJs, NextJs, styled-components, NestJs, Jest and others.

My efforts today are focused on me getting up to speed on software engineering and studying English.
